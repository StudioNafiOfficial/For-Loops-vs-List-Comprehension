# For-Loops-vs-List-Comprehension

I was very bored, so...

 This is a graph that showcases the time difference between using for loops and list comprehension. I just ran two functions that took a input and made a list of the range of the input (for for_loop I appended each number between 0 and n and for list_comprehension i just returned [x for x in range(n)]).

 I then gave each function a random number between 1,000 and 2,000,000, recorded the time taken, repeated this 300 times, and voila!, beautiful data.
